# LexicalAnalyzer-ToyLanguage
This is a Lexical Analyzer for a Toy Language

In this practice we want to create the following instructions:
- INTEGER -> SEQUENCE OF DIGITS
- REGISTER -> # + [A, B, C, D]
- OPERATION -> [SUM, SUB, MUL, DIV]
- ASSIGNMENT -> MOV
- EOF -> ;

**Deterministic finite automaton for our language:**
